# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
- Focus on what is best for the community.
- Show empathy towards other community members.

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by opening a private GitHub Security Advisory or by contacting the
maintainer via their GitHub profile. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1.
