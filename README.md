## ‚ú® Features

LLPlayer has many features for language learning that are not available in normal video players.

- **Dual Subtitles:** Two subtitles can be displayed simultaneously. Both text subtitles and bitmap subtitles are supported.
- **AI-generated subtitles (ASR):** Real-time automatic subtitle generation from any video and audio, powered by [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). **100** languages are suported!
- **Real-time Translation:** Supports Google and DeepL API, **134** languages are currently supported!
- **Real-time OCR subtitles:** Can convert bitmap subtitles to text subtitles in real time, powered by [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and Microsoft OCR.
- **Subtitles Sidebar:** Both text and bitmap are supported. Seek and word lookup available. Has anti-spoiler functionality.
- **Instant word lookup:** Word lookup and browser searches can be performed on subtitle text.
- **Customizable Browser Search:** Browser searches can be performed from the context menu of a word, and the search site can be completely customized.
- **Plays online videos:** With [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) integration, any online video can be played back in real time, with AI subtitle generation, word lookups!
- **Flexible Subtitles Size/Placement Settings:** The size and position of the dual subtitles can be adjusted very flexibly.
- **Subtitles Seeking for any format:** Any subtitle format can be used for subtitle seek.
- **Built-in Subtitles Downloader:** Supports opensubtitles.org

## ‚úÖ Requirements

[OS]
* Windows 10, Version 1903 later
* Windows 11

[Pre-requisites]
* [.NET Desktop Runtime 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)
  * If not installed, a installer dialog will appear
* [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Version >= 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version) (for Whisper ASR, Tesseract OCR)
  * Note that if this is not installed, the app will launch, but **will crash when ASR or OCR is enabled**!

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Download builds from [release](https://github.com/umlx5h/LLPlayer/releases)**

It is a portable application compressed in 7zip format.  
If you cannot unzip, please install 7zip beforehand.

https://www.7-zip.org/

2. **Launch LLPlayer**

Please open `LLPlayer.exe`.

3. **Open Settings**

Press `CTRL+.` or click the settings icon on the seek bar to open the settings window.

4. **Download Whisper Model for ASR**

From `Subtitles > ASR` section, please download Whisper's models.
You can choose from a variety of models, the larger the size, the higher the load and accuracy.

Note that models with `.en` endings are only available in English.

`Audio Language` allows you to manually set the language of the video (audio). The default is auto-detection.

Hardware acceleration can be configured in the `Whisper Hardware Options` at the bottom.

If `CUDA`, `Vulkan`, or `OpenVINO` is available on your machine, move it to the right column and set its priority. You may be able to generate subtitles very fast.

5. **Download Tesseract Model for OCR (optional)**

If you want to use OCR for bitmap subtitles, please download Tesseract's Model. (You can also use Microsoft OCR)

From `Subtitles > OCR` section, you can download Tesseract models.
Note that there is a model for each language.

6. **Set Translation Target Language (optional)**

To use the translation function, please set your native language. This is called the `target language`.
The `source language` is almost always detected automatically.

From `Subtitles > Translate` section, please set the `Target Language` at the top.

The default translation engine is Google Translate.

You can change it to DeepL from the settings below, but you will need to configure API key. (free for a certain amount of use)

7. **Place `yt-dlp.exe` to project (optional)**

If you want to play online videos such as Youtube, please place `yt-dlp.exe` in your project.

There is currently no downloader in the application. You can download it from the following.

https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/

Please place it in the following path.

`Plugins/YoutubeDL/yt-dlp.exe`

8. **Play any videos with subtitles!**

You can play it from the context menu or by dropping the video.

If `yt-dlp` is installed, you can also play it by pasting the URL with `CTRL+V` (or from context menu).

There are two `CC` buttons on the bottom seek bar.

The left is the primary subtitle and the right is the secondary subtitle.
Please set your learning language for the primary subtitle and your native language for the secondary subtitle.

From here you can change built-in subtitles, external subtitles, ASR subtitles, OCR subtitles, and there is a toggle for the translation function.

9. **Open CheatSheet**

You can open a built-in CheatSheet by pressing `F1` or from ContextMenu.

All keyboard and mouse controls are explained.
Keyboard controls are fully customizable from the settings.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Development Status

Status: `Beta`  
Condition: `Not Stable`

It has not yet been tested by enough users and may be unstable.

Significant changes may be made to the UI and settings.  
I will actively make breaking changes during version `0.X.X`.

(Configuration files may not be backward compatible when updated.)

## üî® Build

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:umlx5h/LLPlayer.git
```

2. **Open Project**

Install Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider and open the following sln file.

```bash
$ ./LLPlayer.sln
```

3. **Build**

Select `LLPlayer` project and then build and run.

## ü§ù Contribution

Contributions are very welcome! Development is easy because it is written in C#/WPF.

If you want to improve the core of the video player other than language functions,
LLPlayer uses Flyleaf as a core player library, so if you submit it there, I will actively incorporate the changes into the LLPlayer side.

https://github.com/SuRGeoNix/Flyleaf

I may not be able to respond to all questions or requests regarding core player parts as I do not currently understand many of them yet.

## üôè Special Thanks

LLPlayer would not exist without the following!

### For Libraries

* [SuRGeoNix/Flyleaf](https://github.com/SuRGeoNix/Flyleaf)

In implementing LLPlayer, I used the Flyleaf .NET library instead of [libmpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/master/libmpv) or [libVLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html), and I think it was the right decision!

The simplicity of the library makes it easy to modify, and development productivity is very high using C#/.NET and Visual Studio.

With libmpv and libVLC, modifications on the library side would be super difficult.

The author has been very helpful in answering beginner questions and responding very quickly.

Flyleaf comes with a sample WPF player, and I used quite a bit. Thank you very much.

* [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
* [sandrohanea/whisper.net](https://github.com/sandrohanea/whisper.net)
* [ggerganov/whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)

Subtitle generation is achived by OpenAI Whisper, whisper.cpp and its binding whisper.net.
LLPlayer simply uses these libraries to generate subtitles.
Thank you for providing this for free!

* [Sicos1977/TesseractOCR](https://github.com/Sicos1977/TesseractOCR) : For Tessseract OCR
* [MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit) : For UI
* [searchpioneer/lingua-dotnet](https://github.com/searchpioneer/lingua-dotnet) : For Language Detection
* [sskodje/WpfColorFont](https://github.com/sskodje/WpfColorFont) : For Font Selection


### For Apps

* [Language Reactor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/language-reactor/hoombieeljmmljlkjmnheibnpciblicm)

Browser Extension for Netflix.
LLPlayer is mainly inspired by this with its functionality and interface.
(Not enough functionality yet, though).

## ‚ùì FAQ

#### Q: LLPlayer is free?

It is completely free under the GPL license. There are no plans to monetize it in the future.

The reason is that I am simply combining existing OSS.

Without free OSS libraries, LLPlayer could not exist. Therefore, it must be free.

#### Q: Why perform ASR and OCR in real time?
There is no need to wait for completion to enable subtitles.
The latest technology and hardwares also allow for more faster and accurate subtitles.

LLPlayer can also start subtitle generation from any video position. This means that even long videos can be viewed immediately with subtitles.

In addition, LLplayer works with `yt-dlp` to allow users to view any online video while generating subtitles in real time!

If you want to generate and edit them in advance, you can use [SubtitleEdit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit) instead.

#### Q: Is external network communication required?

All ASR and OCR are executed locally and do not communicate externally.
However, the models need to be downloaded for the first time, so communication is required only for that.

Network communication is required to use the subtitle translation and word translation functions.

These are optional features that can be opted out, so if they are not used, no communication is performed at all.

#### Q: How can I speed up the ASR?

By default, only the CPU is used to generate subtitles.
Setting `Threads` to `2 or more` from the ASR settings may improve performance.

Note that setting it above the number of CPU threads is meaningless.

If your machine is equipped with a NVIDIA or AMD GPU, you can expect even faster generation by enabling `CUDA` or `Vulkan` from the `Hardware Options` in the ASR settings.

Certain runtimes may require a toolkit to be installed in advance. See the link below for details.

https://github.com/sandrohanea/whisper.net?tab=readme-ov-file#runtimes-description

The available ones will be used in order of priority from the top. Note that changing the hardware options settings will require a restart.

#### Q: What if I want to look up a dictionary from a word?

You can translate words, but cannot currently look up dictionaries.

I plan to support the dictionary API in the future, but is not currently supported because it is difficult to support a lot of languages.

Instead, you can copy selected words to the clipboard.
Certain dictionary tools can monitor the clipboard and search for words.

For English-English dictionaries, [LDOCE5 Viewer](https://github.com/ciscorn/ldoce5viewer) is highly recommended.

#### Q: Why is it written in C#/WPF?

Because the [Flyleaf](https://github.com/SuRGeoNix/Flyleaf) library was available. It would probably be difficult to use [libmpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/master/libmpv) or [libVLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html) in achieving similar functionality for me.
The challenge is that these are difficult to modify on the library side.  
Even building them from scratch is quite challenging.

I also believe that there is no better environment for creating Windows desktop applications other than C#/WPF.

I also thought that WPF would be suitable for the future because of the ease of cross-platform development using Avalonia.

#### Q: When will you support cross-platform?

LLPlayer uses the Flyleaf library in its core video player.  
In order to support cross-platform, this library side needs to be supported first. Therefore, I cannot do it alone.

The Flyleaf library will be cross-platform in v4, and there will be [various improvements](
https://github.com/SuRGeoNix/Flyleaf/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Av4) such as live streaming cache.

Class platform ETA  
https://github.com/SuRGeoNix/Flyleaf/discussions/543

As soon as this is released, I will begin the transition in parallel with learning Avalonia.

Until it is released, I will continue to make various improvements on Windows only.

#### Q: How does the ASR feature differ from VLC?

VLC is also likely to add Whisper-based features in the future.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/vlc-tops-6-billion-downloads-previews-ai-generated-subtitles/

This is a guess since it is not available at this time, but I predict that VLC does not use translation engines such as Google or DeepL at all. So it can probably only be translated into English. Because they claim they do not require network communications to translate.

If Whisper is used to translate, it currently only supports English.
Therefore, other translation engines will be required to translate into languages other than English.

In contrast, LLPlayer not only uses Whisper to translate in English, but also uses a separate translation engine to translate into any language.

VLC may be using a local translation LLM, but the accuracy and speed will be less than Google or DeepL at this time.
Unlike video and audio, subtitle data is text data and its size is very small, so there is little advantage in using local AI for translation.

The only advantage would be to meet the demand for local execution over convenience.

LLPlayer also has language learning-specific features such as subtitle sidebar, subtitles seek, dual subtitles, and word translation, and I believe this is what differentiates it.

I think that simply generating subtitles is not so much useful. It is important to add value in connection with it. A general purpose video player will possibly not be able to achieve that.

For example, they will not add Japanese-specific features, but I plan to.
