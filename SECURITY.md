# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
LingoView is under active development. Security fixes will be applied to the latest main branch and recent tagged releases where feasible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.
- Instead, open a private GitHub Security Advisory for `tetsuose/LingoView` or contact the maintainer directly via their GitHub profile.
- Include as much detail as possible: affected versions, environment, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.

We will acknowledge and triage valid reports as quickly as possible.
